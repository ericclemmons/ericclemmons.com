After much testing of our internal API, we made it available for several sites to use & got _terrible_ performance.

Of course, we got better performance with Node than we did with PHP, thanks to `async` parallelizing functions, but we didn't think _too much_ about Node's
single-threaded nature.

We already had several sites using the API with more being added daily, all causing performance to quickly dwindle.

---

In a rush, we discovered Node's [`cluster`][cluster] module, which I don't remember from `v0.6`, but is pretty reliable in `v0.10`.

Per the [`cluster`][cluster] documentation:

> A single instance of Node runs in a single thread. To take advantage of
> multi-core systems the user will sometimes want to launch a cluster of
> Node processes to handle the load.
>
> The cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that all
> share server ports.

Implementation was _dead easy_.

### 1. Setup our Express application for easy use via `require`:

```js
// app/server.js
var app = require("./app");
var http = require("http");

http.createServer(app).listen(app.get("port"), function() {
  console.log("Express server listening on port " + app.get("port"));
});
```

For development, we will run `node app/server`:

```shell
$ node app/server.js
Express server listening on port 3000
```

### 2. Create `cluster.js`

```js
// app/cluster.js

var cluster = require("cluster");

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Count the machine's CPUs
  var cpuCount = require("os").cpus().length;

  // Create a worker for each CPU
  for (var i = 0; i < cpuCount; i += 1) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  // Listen for dying workers & start 'em back up!
  cluster.on("exit", function() {
    cluster.fork();
  });
} else {
  require("./server");
}
```

### 3. Update `package.json` to use `cluster.js`

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app/cluster"
  }
}
```

### 4. Done!

Now on production, `npm start` will run `node app/cluster` and spawn up 4+ instances:

```shell
$ npm start

> api@1.4.2 start /Users/deploy/api
> node app/cluster

Express server listening on port 3000
Express server listening on port 3000
Express server listening on port 3000
```
