title: Write Functional Tests & Assertions
---

Today while addressing [a bug in Amplify JS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/pull/4507),
I found a [passing test that was **broken**](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/blob/980307b1fbb901399e69f8a9ba98f830e42d5d78/packages/analytics/__tests__/Providers/AWSPinpointProvider-unit-test.ts#L731-L749):

```js
expect(reject).toBeCalled();
```

It turns out, the implementation had a runtime error in it:

```js
try {
  someUndefinedFunction();
} catch (error) {
  // ReferenceError: someUndefinedFunction is not defined
  reject(error);
}
```

But because the `expect` only tested that an error _happened_,
we couldn't differentiate between an _expected_ vs. _unexpected_ error.

### Tests should be functional: given _this_ input, I expect _that_ output.

```js
// This is OK for testing that a logic gate is called
expect(reject).toBeCalled();
// ðŸŽ‰ This is *better* for enforcing API contracts
expect(reject).toBeCalledWith(expectedError);
```

Now, our application is more resilient to regressions with:

1. The logic gate for calling `reject`.
1. The type & shape of the error passed to `reject`.
