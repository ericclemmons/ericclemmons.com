It's inevitable: you _will_ have circular dependencies at some point in your project.

Unfortunately, I've had this issue time & time again and didn't quite realize _why_
it was happening until recently.

### The Problem

> When a file is `require`d in Node, its `module.exports` is immediately
> defined as an empty `{}`.

Most of my code was written like so, where I exported my object _at the end_ of the file:

```js
// my-factory.js
var factoryFeatures = require('./features');

var MyFactory = function(deps) {
  ...
};

MyFactory.prototype.build = function(specs) {
  ...
  // Create something from the provided specs using
  // the required `factoryFeatures`.
  ...
};

module.exports = MyFactory;
```

The moment one of my dependencies (say, via line `#2`) attempted to
`require('../my-factory')`, it would get a reference to that empty `{}`.

But, everything goes off the rails during runtime because, on line `#15`,
_I've overridden `{}` with `MyFactory`_!

### The Solution

Add methods/factories onto the initial `{}` so references are never overwritten:

```js
// my-factory.js
...

// Notice how the function is exported as an additional {} property
module.exports.factory = MyFactory;
```

This way, at runtime, `factory` is available via the original `module.exports` reference.

Now all circular dependencies are referencing the same object from the first
`require` to the last!
