By default AngularJS' [`$locationProvider`][1] defaults to URLs like:

> http://localhost:3000/#/admin/

If in the future you may decide on one of the following:

- Your application's URLs will [should have longevity][2].
- You may switch from AngularJS to [another framework][3].
- You may render URLs on the server to [improve performance, like Twitter.com did][4].

Then, you should switch to HTML5 routing instead of using the default hash URLs.

Besides, **it's easy and takes 2 minutes**.

### Step 1: Re-enable `X-Requested-With` Header

For some reason, this was removed around [v1.1.5][6], but it's crucial
for your AngularJS app to tell your server when it's making AJAX requests
for, say, an `ng-include` or `templateUrl`.

```js
// client/app.js
angular.module("app", []).config([
  "$httpProvider",
  function($httpProvider) {
    // Expose XHR requests to server
    $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common["X-Requested-With"] =
      "XMLHttpRequest";
  }
]);
```

### Step 2: Enable HTML5 Routing

```js
// client/app.js
angular.module("app", []).config([
  "$httpProvider",
  "$locationProvider",
  function($httpProvider, $locationProvider) {
    // Expose XHR requests to server
    $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common["X-Requested-With"] =
      "XMLHttpRequest";

    // This is `false` by default
    $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
  }
]);
```

### Step 3: Create a Wildcard Route

Assuming you're using [express][5], the **very last route you define**
will be you're catch-all. This way, any routes you explicitly define on
the server-side are handled there, while any other routes render the
client-side page, AngularJS to handle.

```js
// server/app.js
app.get("/*", function(req, res) {
  // AJAX requests are aren't expected to be redirected to the AngularJS app
  if (req.xhr) {
    return res.status(404).send(req.url + " not found");
  }

  // `sendfile` requires the safe, resolved path to your AngularJS app
  res.sendfile(path.resolve(__dirname + "/path/to/index.html"));
});
```

The important part is the check for `req.xhr`. If you didn't include this,
then using **`ng-include` with a missing template would recursively keep including
your broken application**.

### Caveats

Even though this solution has worked quite well in my experience (plus, it just
feels right), there is one draw back:
**`404`s are now `200`s, as they're now rendered by the client.**

Luckily, this can be remedied a number of ways.

For example, if your server-side application consists of primarily an `/api`
root URL, then you can have `/api/*` act as a catchall to send a legitimate `404`.

If you want to explicitly serve your AngularJS app **only for AngularJS routes**,
then you'll have to do more legwork, where your routes are defined as an `Object`
for use by both the client _and_ server for defining routes.

### Conclusion

Even with those minor nit-picks, I prefer my [SPA][7]s to look & act like
proper, server-rendered sites as much as possible, especially with minimal effort.
