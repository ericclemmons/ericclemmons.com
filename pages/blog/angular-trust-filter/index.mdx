It seems every Angular project I write, at some point, sees the error:

> `Attempting to use an unsafe value in a safe context.`

This is because of Angular's [`$sce`][1] service, which _enabled_ by default:

> SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.

Unfortunately, it can be cumbersome, especially when working with dynamic objects.

### The View

Suppose you're writing the front-end for a blog where the content is consumed via an AJAX request:

```js
<h1 ng-bind-html="response.title"></h1>

<section ng-bind-html="response.content"></section>
```

When your view attempts to use the raw `response` content, you'll get an error
because it's _unsafe_.

### The Controller

To get around this, you can have your controller "whitelist" the content:

```js
angular
.module('example', [])
.controller('ExampleController', [
'$sce',
    '$scope',
function($sce, $scope) {
...
// Assume there's a previous `$http` response
response['title'] = $sce.trustAsHtml(response['title']);
      response['content'] = $sce.trustAsHtml(response['content']);

      $scope.response = response;
    }

])
;
```

### The Filter

Instead, **create a `trust` filter.**

```js
angular.module("example", []).filter("trust", [
  "$sce",
  function($sce) {
    return function(value, type) {
      // Defaults to treating trusted text as `html`
      return $sce.trustAs(type || "html", text);
    };
  }
]);
```

Now your view an simply read:

```html
<h1 ng-bind-html="response.title | trust"></h1>

<section ng-bind-html="response.content | trust"></section>
```

As with all things Angular, your view will contain your rendering logic and your controllers
can stay as thin as possible.
