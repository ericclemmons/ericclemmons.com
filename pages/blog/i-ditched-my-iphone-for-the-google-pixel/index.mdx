title: I Ditched My iPhone for the Google Pixel.
---

_Note: Several people were genuinely surprised and were curious what my reasons were, as I was an OG iPhone user._

_tldr; Google ecosystem > Apple ecosystem, & the UX is better._

---

As a software developer, I’m constantly looking to improve some sort of **experience**: _user-experience, developer-experience, how-long-will-this-meeting-take-experience_.

When my daily usage of my iPhone (6s) started to have more annoyances than _delights_, I decided to embark on a rather expensive test.

Less than a week of constant use (timed perfectly for constant photo & video snapping over the Thanksgiving holiday), I’d made the decision to switch.

### In a nutshell, the Google ecosystem is a perpetually positive user experience. Apple’s is getting as bad as iTunes.

But who wants to read long, explanatory prose when you can have features fight it out with bold headlines & block quotes? 👊

# Tie: AT&T vs. Project Fi.

On iPhone, I was with AT&T. Originally grandfathered into unlimited data, but lost it during an upgrade process. (_Insert expletives here_)

But unlimited data was never here to stay, so what matters now is **simplicity & transparency of billing**.

### [Project Fi](https://fi.google.com/) is a simple, monthly plan: $20 + $10 per GB. With the Project Fi Widget, my usage is _visibly less_ as a result.

However, there’s a noticeable caveat that my speeds were *sometimes half *on Project Fi compared to AT&T previously (e.g. 30Mbps vs 60Mbps).

For me, I’ll take simplicity & transparency over the speed of consuming costly bits (given a 10Mbps minimum), but this isn’t a defensible position.

# Winner: Pixel’s Fingerprint Scanner (vs. iPhone’s).

When I attempted to unlock my iPhone (or my wife’s), more often than not there was a ritual of button pressing, swiping, & tapping, followed by muted cursing that they removed _Swipe to Unlock_.

The Pixel’s is on the back of the phone, which seemed an odd choice at first, but it’s **incredibly natural to unlock your phone** when you grab it face-down off of a dining table or out of your pocket.

More importantly, my thumb doesn’t have to contort downwards like the iPhone requires.

# Winner: Android (vs. iOS).

It’s worth noting that my experience with Android on my Nexus 6p (for testing 3rd party scripts thrashing the DOM, of course!) was pretty terrible.

### Android on Google Pixel is incredibly helpful, surprisingly intuitive, and smart. It’s never working against you.

This is something that has to be experienced (it _is_ called user-experience for a reason), but some highlights are:

- I opened Google Inbox, as I’ve been doing for a while. **It helpfully prompted me to disable duplicate Gmail notifications**.

- The bottom **back button maintains history across apps**. So, if I click a link in an email to a tweet, click the tweet’s link to Github, open in Chrome, browse a few pages, and then press _back_ several times, I step backwards all the way to the original email.

- **The UI is peppered with helpful hints**. Phone didn’t unlock? *Finger moved too fast. Try again. *Charging over USB? _Charging slowly_ vs. _Charging rapidly_. As a result, **the UI makes the right-path discoverable **instead of making you wonder “Why isn’t this working??”

- **Unpinned apps are tucked away in a lower, *alphabetized *drawer**. In iOS, my screens were a cluster of chronologically-installed apps that was a chore to clean up, losing discoverability.

- The **UI has a consistent, minimal vocabulary**: gears & arrows. An up/down arrow will hide/reveal a drawer, while back/forward navigates history. Gears always take you to contextual settings. It doesn’t _sound_ important, but these 2 ever-present icons make customization & settings _incredibly shallow and attainable._

# Winner: Google Apps (vs. Apple’s).

I take lots of photos & videos. A friend shared this quote with me ahead of our first child being born:

### “The best camera is the one you have on you. And that’s your phone.”

I did my best to categorize (_Picasa! iPhoto! Photos!_) & backup (_TimeCapsule! Dropbox!_) photos, but was insanely frustrated by the difficulty in finding pictures of a recently deceased family member _when I knew I had that one special moment somewhere in my library_.

[**Google Photos**](https://photos.google.com) is incredible. Besides free, original-quality backups, indexing, & facial-recognition, every other day or so I get a delightful notification to *Rediscover *a memory or view an automatically-generated GIF from several snaps of an event.

As a developer, I use Google Chrome. I was completely caught off-guard when researching a performance bug to find that **Chrome on iOS does not use the same rendering engine as Chrome on Android, due to App Store restrictions**:

_Edit: I had something about Google Maps vs. Maps, but that’d just be cruel._

# Closing Thoughts

I bought the Watch (that’s an Apple logo, for those who can’t see it), and now have an expensive time-piece that’s locked into the Apple ecosystem.

What’s depressing is that **the Apple ecosystem isn’t what it used to be, and isn’t worth being entrenched in**.

### Apps can no longer get by with minimal, polished interfaces. They have to be anticipatory, discoverable, and encourage advancement with every interaction.

I suppose I should be mildly concerned about _vendor lock-in_ with Google, but [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) provides a decent escape-hatch when Microsoft ups the ante in a few years.
