Soon, [Next.js will support FS-based routes](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), like
[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Pages),
[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#dynamic-routes),
and my own [polydev](https://github.com/ericclemmons/polydev/#defining-routes)
and [mdx-site](https://github.com/ericclemmons/mdx-site/#authoring).

But, there's one design decision I've made that differs from the rest:
**all routes are `index`-based**.

---

A lot of engineers work **from the bottom up**.

> "I'll connect to the DB, query for the data I need, expose it as an API, then wire it up to the HTML."

But, I've found it more intuitive to work **from the user down**.
(Because, ultimately, the implementation details don't matter).

> "I'll create `/some/url`, hit an API, then return a query from the DB".

### Maybe we can call this approach **`404`-driven-development**.

Since [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI),
designing URL structure _is_ good design.

## The Filesystem _Looks_ Like a URL

Even when I `git clone` a project, **I have a habit of making the filesystem look like a URL**.

For example, my `~/Projects` directory looks like my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/ericclemmons?tab=repositories&type=source):

```shell
$ tree -L2
.
├── ericclemmons
│   ├── mdx-site
│   ├── medium-to-markdown
│   ├── node-recorder
│   ├── polydev
│   └── ...
├── webpack-contrib
│   └── npm-install-webpack-plugin
└── zeit
    └── next.js
```

So it makes sense that projects like [UmiJS](https://umijs.org/guide/router.html#conventional-routing)
would find a way to map `/users/:id` to the filesystem:

```
+ pages/
  + $post/
    - index.js
    - comments.js
  + users/
    $id.js
  - index.js
```

In my projects, however, **I whitelist `index.*` files** for route creation.

## Why Indexes Matter

For a small project, this seems fine:

```
pages/
  index.js
  about.js
  contact-us.js
```

But, as complexity grows, you'll find yourself with an _underscore smell_:

```
pages/
  _app.js
  _document.js
  _layout.js
  _fetchFromDB.js
  ...
  index.js
  about.js
  contact-us.js
```

Because every file under `pages/` _automatically becomes a page_,
we have to find ways to get these files _blacklisted_.

### When designing URL structure upfront, a whitelist allows our app to grow without side-effects.

For comparison, my suggested structure is:

```
pages/
  index.js
  about/
    index.js
  contact-us/
    index.js
```

## Benefits to Index-based Routes

- Statically compiling `about/index.js` to `about/index.html` is well-suppored by many static servers at the URL `/about`.

- Dependencies of `index.js` can be called whatever you'd like, without accidentally generating new pages for each file.

- Customizing the extension allows for more functionality in the future:

  - `post/:id/index.GET.js` could return `/post/123`.

  - `post/:id/index.POST.js` could handle updating `/post/123`'s content.

  - `post/:id/index.*.js` could be a fallback for `/post/123/*` & show a custom `404` page.

Of course, what people choose for denoting parameters (e.g. `:`, `[]`, `$`)
has to be a [valid filename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Reserved_characters_and_words),
but the most important goal is to **provide an quick, intuitive path from the URL in the browser to the file serving it**.
