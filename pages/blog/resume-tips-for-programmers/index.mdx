I've been on a hiring spree this year trying to find new coworkers [@CMN][1].

Last year (2014), I naively hoped that through connections, social networking,
conferences, and meetups, I'd stumble across someone that'd love to work together.

I didn't put in nearly the effort I should have, so both [Eric Rasch][2] & I are
pulling a recruiting hat-trick with:

1. A good recruiter
2. [Hired][3]
3. [Authentic Jobs][4]

Going through **dozens upon dozens** of CVs, I've noticed a consistent trend
with both good & bad résumé patterns.

> I desperately want every candidate to work out.
>
> **I'm rooting for you.**
> But, there are several résumé mistakes that you'll spend the entire
> interview _fighting against_.

## Bad Résumés

### 1. Listing technologies that you won't take a job for.

You put _Node.js_ on your résumé. I personally love fullstack JavaScript development,
so we talk. Within minutes, I find out you _abhor_ JavaScript as a language and
only listed it because you had been _forced_ to use it.

My advice? **Delete any technology you don't like, even if you've used it.**

Or, if you're a **technology hoarder** and can't let go of all of your accomplishments,
create a special category for _Experienced, but Unfavorable Tech_. At least I
can clearly discern from what you _want_ to do and what you _don't_.

### 2. Including tools that _everyone_ is familiar with.

It's your duty to ensure that your résumé **distinguishes you** from the crowd.

> Prominently listing common tools (e.g. _cURL_, _Gem_, _Bower_, _Yeoman_, etc.)
> is a needless waste of space that implies an **equal, cursory understanding** of all
> other tech surrounding it.

If you list _Yeoman_, you **should know how to write a Yeoman Generator**.

If you list _NPM_, you **should be able to explain how to develop packages locally
and use it as a build tool**.

### 3. Listing _what_ you used at your previous jobs, but not _why_.

You're being hired (and subsequently paid) **to make a positive impact**.

Every reference you have should clearly explain **why the company is in a better
place _because of you_.**

You changed a blog platform from _Drupal_ to _WordPress_? **Why?**
For a 200+% increase in speed? For rapid iterations on features? For a common,
familiar platform that the team can cohesively develop on? Pick _something_.

I know that some jobs have throwaway work that you're not proud of, or did not
make a markedly good difference. Of course, _not everything can be a winner_.

But, surely there was some way _you became a better programmer as a result_, right?

## Good Résumés

### 1. Have a clear _"Make me move"_ objective.

At the top of your résumé, **clearly state how you would like to contribute to
your next company & what you would like to be doing technologically**.

Perhaps 1 in 10 people do this (or do it well), and it _immediately_ warrants a
1st interview and a clear conversation path.

**Either I have something to offer you or I don't**. Otherwise, we both spend
the next 30-60 minutes feeling out if it's good fit.

### 2. Listing any & all projects you've contributed to.

Some contributions are minor (e.g. fixing typos), but any real contribution
(e.g. code or docs) warrants reference.

The fact that you've selflessly (or even selfishly) improved documentation,
added a feature, or heck, even reported a bug is worthy fodder for discussion!

> There's no better public indicator of how you work with a team as
> open-source software.

Yes, the mantra of _Github is your résumé_ is fallible. But, there has to be
at least _one_ open-source project you've used in the last year. The odds are
very good you encountered either a bug, a missing feature, or some unclear
documentation.

Before sending off that résumé, put on some music, uncork a bottle of wine, and
hit up your favorite projects to contribute some docs, discuss some issues,
or write tests for an outstanding issue (right after your second bottle).

### 3. Clearly indicating the positive impact they've had in the past.

Companies want to read your résumé and think&hellip;

> I hope they can do for us what they did for them!

Personally, I'm a fan of anything that has a percentage sign or unit of measurement
attached to it:

- _Reduced application errors from 2.3% to 0.7% on a 30-day average._
- _Decreased bounce-rate on checkout page from 62% to 48%._
- _Reduced server-side response times from 650ms to 230ms._

## tl;dr

Your résumé should not simply state _what you did_, but sell **what you can _do_**.
